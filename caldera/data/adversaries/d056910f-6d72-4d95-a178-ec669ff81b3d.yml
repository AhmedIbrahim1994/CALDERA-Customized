description: We emulated initial compromise via a malicious executable sent in a spearphishing
  email. Delivery was out of scope for our evaluation, so Step 1 began with a legitimate
  user executing the payload on the victim host, which was a Remote Access Tool (RAT)
  that connected back to our attacker infrastructure for tasking. The malicious executable
  was a self-extracting archive that established persistence and launched an initial
  callback through a C2 channel.
