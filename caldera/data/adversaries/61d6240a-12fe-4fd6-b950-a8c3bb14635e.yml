description: "We emulated privilege escalation by elevating our RAT\u2019s process\
  \ integrity level from medium to high, while maintaining the current user. Step\
  \ 3 began with the execution of a User Account Control (UAC) bypass technique included\
  \ in Cobalt Strike. The UAC Bypass technique resulted in a high integrity process\
  \ that had limited functionality, but it allowed us to inject into an already existing\
  \ high-integrity process, which was not limited in functionality. The targeted high-integrity\
  \ process in this case was an elevated command-prompt started previously as the\
  \ legitimate user."
